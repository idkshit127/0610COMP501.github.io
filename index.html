<em><p>Throughout this project we will be focusing on a particular topic revolving around technology that influences society. The first thing we will do is determine a focus point for our project which will be dictated by us narrowing down a search from a broader topic to a sub-topic and then to a focus point where we find more detail on a particular aspect of that technology.</em></p>

<em><p>After we have found our topic, we will then do extensive research about this and gather all the information we need to discuss the Opportunities, Risks and choices that come with our chosen topic. We will then reference our sources of this information. After this, each of our group will write an ethical reflection on the project and discuss the support process.</em></p>
