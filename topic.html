<h1 align="center" style="color:yellow"><u>Chosen Technology/Topic</u></h1>


</ul><h5><p style="color:yellow">The page or area describing your chosen technology/topic and why it is significant and/or has important implications for society.<p></h5>

<p style="color:yellow"><em>When deciding on your chosen technology/topic, it is best not to choose something too broad, but limit the focus e.g. consider the level of social analysis from the figure below.</p></em>
<p style="color:red"><em>E.g. What is the level of analysis - culture or organization; Responsibility - individual or pro fessional; Ethical issue - power or equity; Technology - medical, nuclear, mobile?</p></em>


<p style="color:yellow"><b>Description:</b> In this page we will discuss our chosen topic. We started off by brainstorming ideas and then deciding on a broad topic before narrowing our search down to a particular focus point. This focus point would be the idea that we evaluate throughout this process and determine the opportunities, risks, choices, ethics, regarding this topic as well our references and process support.</p> 

 

<p align="center" style="color:yellow"><b><u>Artificial intelligence</u></b></p> 

<p style="color:yellow">AI (Artificial Intelligence) is one of the fastest growing new features of the tech world, where intelligence is controlled by new computer systems/machines.
 It is also used for many different industries such as mechatronics, software, biotechnology, and the medical world. 
 Projections show that AI in the automotive industry will have a compound annual growth rate of almost 40 percent reaching $15.9 billion by the year 2027.
 With the growing technology, AI can be an advantage on how things will work and make life easier for humans. 
 Although AI has proved extremely helpful, we have recently seen a reluctance in the development of artificial intelligence 
 due to many people believing that AI algorithms are allowing the technology to grow and operate on its own to an extent that it is becoming too powerful.
 In the coming future, we will see all fields start using Artificial Intelligence and how it will play an effective role in securing jobs and growth.</p> 

 

<p align="center" style="color:yellow"><b><u>Cars</u></b></p> 

<p style="color:yellow">The world uses cars to travel from one destination to another, and through decades we have seen how cars have evolved from chariots to vintage cars, 
from Honda to Tesla, this world has seen the rise of so many new car companies and manufacturers which are making new cars with the help of rising technology. 
Since Artificial Intelligence is growing in all aspects of the tech world, cars are also included, and with the use of AI, 
there are a variety of ways we can control cars with sensors and new features added to them.</p>  

 

<p align="center" style="color:yellow"><b><u>Tesla and their use of AI technology in cars</u></b></p>

<p style="color:yellow">Tesla is one of the biggest automobile industries in the world and it is still growing rapidly, it is also one of the first car companies which launched electric vehicles and hi-tech cars.
So with the rise of this modern technology, it is obvious that there will be many threat actors who will look to break into cars using advanced software and gadgets, 
with the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI), cars have new features included in the car such as voice commands, detection of the car owner, auto-sensors etc. 
With the introduction of these new features there have also been vulnerabilities that have arisen because of untrialed and untested technology such as hackers and malfunctions in the technology. 
Recently Telsa have been hacked for their car for model 3, even though this was a test, but this showed how easy it was for hackers to hack in cars with AI technology. It is also important to note
that although these are the current problems which are there in Tesla vehicles, security researchers are looking to eradicate them and make Tesla cars safer for everyone to use.</p>
