<h1>Technology Opportunities</h1>


</ul><h4><p>The page or area describing the opportunities presented by your chosen technology/topic.<p></h4>

<p><em><b>Description:</b> In this page we will discuss potential opportunities that can arise from AI technology in cars. Specifically, regarding the launch of Tesla and their electric vehicles that implement this new AI related technology.</p></em> 

<p><em><b>Programmers:</b> One of the opportunities that has arisen from the introduction of Tesla is the chance for young programmers to get jobs due to their experience in the modern technology that Tesla implements. Programming has become an increasing interest in young people with the demand for developer-related jobs set to increase 25% from 2021-2031, as society becomes more reliant on AI technology in everyday life. These young programmers can pursue a career in the system development of electric vehicles and contribute their new ideas to the progression of electric vehicles and AI technology in cars.</p></em>  

<p><em><b>Crash Rates:</b> Another opportunity that could arise with the implementation of AI technology in Tesla is the potential to reduce crash rates. There was a study conducted recently in the United Sates regarding the crash rates in Tesla with autopilot technology compared to Tesla that do not use autopilot technology as well as the average crash rates for other vehicles. It was shown that for every crash Tesla with autopilot technology covered just under 5 million miles (about 80,467,20 km), whilst Tesla that did not use this technology covered around 1.5 million miles (about 24,140,16 km), with the average for other vehicles being roughly 0.5 million miles (about 80,467,2 km). This is a huge opportunity for AI technology to use its autopilot features to reduce the risk of harm to drivers by detecting potential hazards on the road. They also alert operators to when they are going over the speed limit or if there is a problem with the car itself.</p></em>   

<p><em><b>Data Analysis:</b> With the use of Artificial intelligence in cars, vehicles that use this technology can now determine factors such as speed, damage, fuel usage, time driven etc. This happens in thousands of vehicles across the world each day. With the significant amount of data being produced from these recordings it gives us a greater knowledge of what is happening in these vehicles. The data collected can be analyzed by the manufacturer where they can determine what is happening in the vehicle and what future adjustments can be made in the design process. This data could also be given to counsels that determine road conditions to give them a greater understanding of the road conditions in certain places. For example, if the data showed that there was a corner that required significant speed reduction and currently the signs around that corner suggested a greater speed that what cars are travelling, they could adjust this sign to ensure that the possibility of future accidents is reduced. This would lead to a better driving experience for all road users.</p></em>
