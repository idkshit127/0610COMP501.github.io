<h1>Technology Risks</h1>


</ul><h4><p>The page or area describing the risks posed by your chosen technology/topic.<p></h4>

<p><em><b>Description:</b> In this page we will be discussing the risks that come with the use of AI technology in electric cars such as Tesla. We will also discuss the potential consequences that come with these risks.</p></em>

<p><em><b>Elderly Adaption:</b> One of the risks with AI technology being used in cars is the implementation of this concept to elderly drivers. Many elderly people struggle to grasp the concept of new technology as they have gotten used to doing things in a certain way, such as driving. Due to this many older individuals choose not to utilise electric vehicles such as Tesla. This is a risk as it shows the market for cars that implement AI technology is limited and would therefore lead to less purchases of these vehicles.</p></em> 

<p><em><b>Hackers:</b> Another risk is hackers being able to remotely access vehicles such as Tesla. There have been a number of attacks on electric vehicles such as Tesla's by hackers that can use newfound techniques to get into the Tesla cars networks. This has resulted in hackers remotely unlocking the cars and taking personal belongings from inside the vehicle. Although the rate of these break ins has been relatively low to date, many hackers are becoming more aware of the variability of these vehicles, and it is predicted the rate of Tesla break ins will increase significantly. Recently Tesla hosted a competition challenging hackers to try to break through the Tesla model 3â€™s system, unfortunately there were various successes in accessing the cars system hence showing the vulnerability in the security of these electric vehicles.</p></em>  

<p><em><b>Malfunctions:</b> Although the technology used is modern its methods are not often proved and do not have considerable evidence behind them and due to this many malfunctions occur in electric vehicles. In 2020 Tesla vehicles that used their self-driving (autopilot) technology were experiencing issues with the way the cars behaved around intersections and posted speed limits, this led to various accidents (resulting in many injuries) and forced Tesla to recall 363,000 cars that used their self-driving (autopilot) technology. The equipment used to make the autopilot technology used in Tesla is expensive and requires significant funds to restore.</p></em>
