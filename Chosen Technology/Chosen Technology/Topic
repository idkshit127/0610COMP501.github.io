<h1>Chosen Technology/Topic</h1>


</ul><h5><p>The page or area describing your chosen technology/topic and why it is significant and/or has important implications for society.<p></h5>

<p><em>When deciding on your chosen technology/topic, it is best not to choose something too broad, but limit the focus e.g. consider the level of social analysis from the figure below.</p></em>
<p><em>E.g. What is the level of analysis - culture or organization; Responsibility - individual or pro fessional; Ethical issue - power or equity; Technology - medical, nuclear, mobile?</p></em>


<p><em>AI is one of the fastest growing new features of the tech world, where intelligence is controlled by new computer systems/machines. It is also used for many different industries such as the engineering and the medical worlds. With the growing technology, AI can be an advantage on how things will work and make things easier for humans.</p></em>

<p><em>The world uses cars to travel from one destination to another, and through decades we have seen how cars have evolved from chariots to vintage cars, from Honda to Tesla, this world has seen the rise of so many new car companies and manufacturers which are making new cars with the help of rising technology. Since Artificial Intelligence is growing in all aspects of the tech world, cars are also included, and with the use of AI, there are a variety of ways we can control cars with sensors and new features added to them.</p></em>

<p></em>Tesla is one of the biggest automobile industries in the world and it is growing rapidly.  Tesla is also one of the first car companies which launched electric vehicles and hi-tech cars, so with the rise of this modern technology, it is obvious that there will be many threat actors who will look to break into cars using advanced software and gadgets. Now with the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI), cars have new features included in the car such as voice commands, detection of the car owner etc.</p></em>
